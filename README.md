## Hi, I'm David

I landed my first role as a full stack developer after teaching myself how to code. Making an immediate impact on the team, I leveraged my diverse technical skillset to introduce new frontend features, integrate Stripe payments and optimize the deployment pipeline. Furthermore, my efforts to modernize security protocols for sensitive data handling contributed to a streamlined developer experience for the team.

My self-taught background has made me especially good at understanding documentation and familiarizing myself with new technologies quickly, and with proven experience in Typescript, Go and Docker, I'm seeking opportunities with collaborative teams where I can solve challenging technical problems and continue growing as a developer.
